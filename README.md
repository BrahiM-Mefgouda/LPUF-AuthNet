# LPUF-AuthNet: A novel Lightweight PUF-Based Tandem Neural Networks, AutoEncoders, and DNN for IoT Device Authentication
This code is used in a manuscript submission under the title: "LPUF-AuthNet: A novel Lightweight PUF-Based Tandem Neural Networks, AutoEncoders, and Deep Neural Networks for IoT Device Authentication".
## Overview
This paper explores the challenges of securing IoT devices, particularly in authentication processes. The widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized various aspects of daily life through advanced connectivity, automation, and intelligent decision-making. However, traditional cryptographic methods often struggle with the constraints of IoT devices, such as limited computational power and storage.

We investigate physical unclonable functions (PUFs) as robust security solutions, utilizing their inherent physical uniqueness to authenticate devices securely. Our research addresses the limitations of traditional PUF systems, which are vulnerable to machine learning attacks and burdened by large datasets. We propose a novel lightweight PUF mechanism, **called LPUF-AuthNet**, which combines **tandem neural networks**, **Deep neural networks**, and **autoencoders** within a **split learning framework**.
