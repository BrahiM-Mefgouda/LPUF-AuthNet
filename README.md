# A-Lightweight-Neural-Network-Autoencoder-and-Split-Learning-PUF-Based-IoT-Device-Authentication

This repository contains the code for the paper titled "A Lightweight Neural Network Autoencoder and Split Learning PUF-Based IoT Device Authentication." The paper presents a novel approach for IoT device authentication by integrating split learning with a neural network autoencoder and Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). This combination enhances security and efficiency, particularly for resource-constrained IoT devices.
